# Wuthering Waves Skill Mapping
A simple program (Python project) I made out of boredom to automatically format character's skill (kits) from WutheringData.

## How to Use
* Download [Skill.json](https://github.com/Dimbreath/WutheringData/blob/master/ConfigDB/Skill.json) and [MultiText.json](https://github.com/Dimbreath/WutheringData/blob/master/TextMap/en/MultiText.json) from Wuthering Data.
* Put it in the same directory/folder as the Python code.
* Download Python (obviously) and Pandas (`pip install pandas`) if you haven't already.
* Open any terminal/command line, and execute: `python skillmapping.py`
* Type in the skill's/kit's ID or name (e.g `1000101` or `feather as blade`)
  * capitalization doesn't matter (case insensitive)
